# Phase 3.5: Branding & Identity - Learning Notes

**Epic:** 3 - QuizMaster V2
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-11-25

## Session 1: Name Brainstorming & Product Vision Alignment

### What We Did

1. **Defined Naming Criteria**
   - Memorable: 5 (highest priority)
   - Descriptive: 1 (low priority - abstract names OK)
   - Available: 5 (highest priority)
   - Unique: 5 (highest priority)
   - Positive: 3
   - Short: 4
   - International: 5 (highest priority)
   - Tone: Approachable

2. **Brainstormed Names Across Categories**
   - Abstract/Evocative: Lumina, Sparq, Nuro, Kova
   - Friendly/Approachable: Quizly, Learnly, Thinkr, Cureo
   - Short & Punchy: Qwiz, Brio, Flux, Nova
   - Compound: MindSpark, BrainFlow, MindFlow

3. **Initial Favorite: MindFlow**
   - Resonated most with user
   - BUT: All domain variations taken (.com, .app, etc.)

4. **Alternative Found: ezquizz**
   - Domain available
   - BUT: Concern raised about international appeal ("ez" = English slang)
   - More importantly: Name focuses on "quiz" not "learning"

### Key Insight: Product Vision Realignment

Reviewed original product vision document (`product_info/quiz-generator-exploration.md`) and discovered:

**Original Vision was LEARNING-focused, not just quiz-focused:**

| Feature | Original Vision | Current State |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Direct Learning ("Teach me about X") | ✅ Planned | ❌ Not built |
| Assessment-First (quizzes) | ✅ Planned | ✅ Built |
| Time-Constrained Learning | ✅ Planned | ❌ Not built |
| Visual Learning (photo upload) | ✅ Planned | ❌ V2 |
| Spaced Repetition | ✅ Planned | ❌ V2 |
| Progress Tracking | ✅ Planned | ✅ Built |

**The "Personal Trainer" Analogy (from original doc):**
> "It's like the difference between having access to a gym (Claude API) vs having a personal trainer app that creates workout plans, tracks progress, adjusts difficulty, and keeps you accountable (Our App)"

**Decision Made:** Option 2 - Expand to Learning, Change Name
- Name should reflect broader learning vision, not just quizzes
- "ezquizz" too narrow for what the product should become

### Domain Hunting Challenges

**Names Checked - All Taken:**
- MindFlow (all variations)
- LearnFlow, Learnly, Thinkr
- All compound names from initial list

**Strategies Suggested for Next Session:**
1. Made-up words (Learnr, Stuvi, Knolio, Memvo)
2. Unique letter combinations (Znap, Kwize, Lrn)
3. Unexpected combinations (SparkPath, MindLoop, BrainBit)
4. Alternative TLDs (.app, .io, .co, .learn, .study)
5. Prefix/suffix patterns (get[name], try[name], [name]app)

## Current Status

**Phase 3.5 Progress:**
- [x] Define naming criteria
- [x] Brainstorm initial names
- [x] Evaluate against criteria
- [x] Align name with product vision (learning, not just quiz)
- [ ] Find available domain
- [ ] Final name decision
- [ ] Visual identity (icon, colors)
- [ ] Update manifest and codebase

**Blocked On:** Finding available domain for learning-focused name

---

## Next Session

1. Continue domain hunting with creative strategies
2. Once name found, check for existing apps with same name
3. Move to visual identity (icon design)
4. Update manifest.json and codebase with new branding

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Product naming is hard** - Most good, short names are taken
2. **Name should match vision** - "ezquizz" was available but too narrow
3. **Revisit original vision** - Easy to get caught up in current features vs. full potential
4. **Made-up words more likely available** - Need to be more creative

## Questions for Future Sessions

- Should we consider alternative TLDs (.app, .io) instead of .com?
- Is there a concept/feeling we want the name to evoke that we haven't explored?
- Would a longer, more descriptive name be acceptable if it's available?
