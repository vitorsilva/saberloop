# Issue #10: Continue Button Not Visible Without Scrolling

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/vitorsilva/saberloop/issues/10
**Branch:** `fix/issue-10-continue-button-visibility`
**Priority:** Medium
**Type:** UX Improvement

---

## Problem Statement

Users cannot see the "Continue" / "Next Question" button after selecting a quiz answer without scrolling down. This creates a frustrating experience where users don't realize they need to scroll to proceed.

### User Feedback
> "Demorei uns 30 segundos a perceber que tinha scroll para ver o botão de continuar"
> (Translation: "It took me about 30 seconds to realize I needed to scroll to see the continue button")

## Current Implementation Analysis

**File:** `src/views/QuizView.js`

**Current Layout Structure:**
```
div.min-h-screen.flex.flex-col
├── div.flex-grow.flex.flex-col (scrollable content)
│   ├── header (back button, title)
│   ├── progress bar
│   ├── main (question text - 28px bold)
│   ├── options container (4 buttons, each min-h-56px)
│   ├── div.flex-grow (spacer - pushes button down)
│   └── div.px-4.py-6 (submit button container)
└── div.sticky.bottom-0.h-20 (bottom navigation)
```

**Issue:** The `flex-grow` spacer pushes the submit button below the viewport on smaller screens or when questions/options have longer text. The button is inside the scrollable area, not sticky.

---

## Proposed Solution

**Approach:** Make the submit button container sticky, positioned above the bottom navigation bar.

### Changes Required

1. **Remove the `flex-grow` spacer** - No longer needed as button will be sticky
2. **Make button container sticky** - Add `sticky bottom-20` (80px = h-20 of nav bar)
3. **Add background** - Ensure button has background so content scrolls behind it cleanly
4. **Add z-index** - Ensure button stays above scrolling content

### Implementation Details

**Before:**
```html
<div class="flex-grow"></div> <!-- Spacer -->

<div class="px-4 py-6">
  <button id="submitBtn" ...>
```

**After:**
```html
<!-- Remove flex-grow spacer -->

<div class="sticky bottom-20 px-4 py-4 bg-background-light dark:bg-background-dark">
  <button id="submitBtn" ...>
```

## Impact Assessment

### Files Modified
- `src/views/QuizView.js` - Layout changes only

### E2E Tests Impact
- Existing tests should continue to pass (button still exists with same ID)
- Tests click `#submitBtn` - no selector changes needed
- May need to verify button is visible without scrolling in new test

### Visual Changes
- Button now always visible at bottom of screen
- Small padding reduction (py-6 → py-4) to fit better
- Content scrolls behind the sticky button area

---

## Test Plan

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test on small viewport (mobile phone size)
   - Verify button visible immediately after selecting answer
   - Verify content scrolls properly behind sticky button
   - Test dark mode appearance

2. **E2E Tests:**
   - Run existing test suite: `npm run test:e2e`
   - All quiz-related tests should pass without modification

3. **Suggested New Test:**
   - Verify submit button is visible in viewport after answer selection (without scrolling)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert the single file change in `QuizView.js` back to original layout with `flex-grow` spacer and non-sticky button.
