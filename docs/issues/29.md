# Issue #29: Quiz button overlap with long answers

**Issue:** https://github.com/vitorsilva/saberloop/issues/29
**Branch:** `fix/issue-29-quiz-button-overlap`
**Created:** 2025-12-25

## Problem Statement

When quiz answers are long (multi-line text), the last answer option (D) gets hidden behind the "Next Question" button at the bottom of the screen.

This is a regression from issue #16 fix, which changed positioning from `sticky` to `fixed`.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

In `src/views/QuizView.js`:

1. **Bottom navigation** (line 103): `fixed bottom-0` with `h-20` (80px)
2. **"Next Question" button** (line 94): `sticky bottom-20` (sticks at 80px from bottom)
3. **Options container** (line 75-89): No bottom padding

The problem: When options are long, they extend into the space where the sticky button sits. The sticky button overlaps the content because:
- The content area doesn't reserve space for the button
- `sticky` positioning means the button overlays content when there's overflow

---

## Solution Design

Add bottom padding to the options container to ensure the last option is never covered by the sticky button.

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Add `pb-24` (96px) to the options container
- Button is h-14 (56px) + py-4 (32px) = ~88px total
- Using pb-24 (96px) gives comfortable margin

**Option 2:** Change button from sticky to fixed and add padding to main content
- More invasive, affects layout structure

Going with **Option 1** - minimal change, targeted fix.

## Files to Change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/views/QuizView.js` | Add `pb-24` to options container (line 76) |
| `tests/e2e/quiz.spec.js` | Add test for long answer visibility |

---

## Testing Plan

### E2E Test (Failing First)

Create a test that:
1. Loads a quiz with long answer options
2. Verifies all 4 options are visible and clickable
3. This test should FAIL before the fix (option D not visible/clickable)

### Manual Testing

1. Generate quiz on complex topic (e.g., "DeFi protocols")
2. Verify all 4 options are visible
3. Verify option D is clickable
4. Test on different screen sizes
