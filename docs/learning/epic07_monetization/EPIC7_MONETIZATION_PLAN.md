# Epic 7: Monetization - Revenue Streams

**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2026-01-06

---

## Executive Summary

Implement a hybrid monetization strategy for Saberloop to achieve break-even revenue of ~€31.25/month. The strategy combines three complementary approaches:

1. **AdSense** - Passive revenue from free-tier users
2. **Donations** - Community support from engaged users
3. **Premium License** - Primary revenue driver with no-backend implementation

**Key insight**: All three monetization methods require ZERO backend infrastructure, keeping operational costs minimal while maximizing revenue potential.

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Ad Network | Google AdSense | Industry standard, good RPM, easy integration |
| Donation Platform | Liberapay | EU-based, EUR-native, 0% platform fees |
| Payment Processor | Paddle | Handles EU VAT, EUR-native, MoR model |
| License Validation | Client-side | No backend needed at small scale |
| Premium Features | Ad-free + extras | Clear value proposition |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Monthly revenue | ≥€31.25 | Payment platforms + AdSense dashboard |
| Ad revenue RPM | >€1 | AdSense dashboard |
| Premium conversion | 10-15% | Licenses sold / MAU |
| Donation rate | 1-2/month | Liberapay dashboard |
| User churn (after ads) | <5% | Telemetry: MAU comparison |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AdSense rejection | Ensure quality content, clear privacy policy, no policy violations |
| Ads hurting UX | Only show during loading screens (natural wait times) |
| Low premium conversion | A/B test pricing and feature set |
| License key sharing | Acceptable at small scale; monitor and reassess |
| GDPR compliance | Cookie consent banner, clear privacy policy |

---

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Phase 61 (Donations)** - Quick win, 1-2 hours
   - Lowest effort, builds community goodwill
   - Start generating revenue immediately

2. **Phase 60 (AdSense)** - 4-5 days + approval wait
   - Passive revenue during LLM loading screens
   - Requires Google approval (1-7 days)

3. **Phase 62 (Premium)** - 2-3 days
   - Primary revenue driver
   - Requires payment processor setup

**Total estimated effort:** 7-10 days (excluding approval waits)
