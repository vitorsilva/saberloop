Key Assumptions:
- AdSense RPM: €20 per 1000 pageviews (conservative)
- Average package price: €9.99 (one-time purchase)
- Quizzes per user: Grows from 3 to 5 as users get engaged
- Growth: 5 MAU month 0 → 50 MAU month 6 (linear)
- Paid users make ONE purchase in their first month (conservative)

Break-Even Analysis:
- 10% conversion: Break-even at Month 3 (30 MAU)
- 5% conversion: Never break-even at 50 MAU (need 65+ MAU)
- 15% conversion: Break-even at Month 2 (20 MAU)

Target: Achieve 10-15% conversion rate to hit €31.25/month by Month 3-4
