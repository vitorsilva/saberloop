# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Saberloop?

Saberloop is an AI-powered quiz application that generates questions on any topic. It's built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning it works offline and can be installed on any device.

### Is it free to use?

The app itself is free. However, AI-generated questions require API credits:
- **With OpenRouter:** You can use your own API key, some free tier models available
- **Server-side API:** Uses the developer's Anthropic credits (may be limited)

### Does it work offline?

Yes! Once you've loaded the app, it works offline:
- Sample quizzes available without internet
- Previously loaded quizzes accessible
- New AI-generated quizzes require internet

## Development

### How do I run the app locally?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorsilva/saberloop.git
cd saberloop
npm install
npm run dev
```

See [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md) for details.

### How do I test with real API?

1. Set `VITE_USE_REAL_API=true` in `.env`
2. Run `npm run dev:php`
3. Go to Settings in the app and connect to OpenRouter
4. Your OpenRouter account provides the API access

### How do I add a new feature?

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make changes
3. Write tests
4. Submit PR

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Architecture

### Why Vanilla JavaScript (no React/Vue)?

This project started as a learning exercise for PWA fundamentals. Vanilla JS:
- No framework overhead
- Teaches core web APIs
- Smaller bundle size
- Better for understanding fundamentals

### Why client-side API calls (not a traditional backend)?

Client-side OpenRouter benefits:
- User provides their own API key via OAuth
- No server-side API key management needed
- Simpler deployment (static files + FTP)
- User controls their own usage/costs

### Why IndexedDB (not localStorage)?

| Feature | localStorage | IndexedDB |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Storage limit | ~5MB | ~50MB+ |
| Data types | Strings only | Any (including blobs) |
| Queries | None | Indexed queries |
| Async | No | Yes |

IndexedDB is better for structured data and larger storage needs.

### How does the mock API work?

When `VITE_USE_REAL_API=false`:
- API calls return pre-defined responses
- No external network requests
- Useful for UI development
- Controlled testing scenarios

## PWA

### How do I install the app?

**Chrome (Desktop):**
1. Visit the site
2. Click install icon in address bar
3. Or: Menu → "Install Saberloop"

**Chrome (Mobile):**

### Why doesn't install prompt appear?

Requirements for install prompt:
- HTTPS (or localhost)
- Valid manifest.json
- Service worker registered
- Not already installed
- Chromium-based browser

Check DevTools → Application → Manifest for issues.

### How do I force service worker update?

## API & AI

### Which AI models are used?

- **Default:** Claude Sonnet (via Anthropic API)
- **OpenRouter:** Various models available (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)

### How accurate are the questions?

AI-generated questions are generally accurate but:
- May occasionally have errors
- Should not be used for critical assessments
- Quality improves with specific topics

### Can I use my own API key?

Yes! Two options:
1. **OpenRouter:** Connect via Settings → Connect to AI Provider
2. **Anthropic (self-hosted):** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your deployment

### What happens if API fails?

The app handles failures gracefully:
- Error message shown to user
- Sample quizzes available offline
- Can retry generation

---

## Data & Privacy

### Where is my data stored?

All data is stored locally in your browser (IndexedDB):
- Quiz sessions
- Scores
- Settings
- API keys (if using OpenRouter)

### Is my data sent anywhere?

- **Quiz content:** Sent to AI provider for generation
- **Personal data:** Not collected or sent anywhere
- **Analytics:** None (no tracking)

### How do I delete my data?

1. DevTools → Application → Storage
2. Click "Clear site data"

Or in Settings → Clear Data (if implemented)

### Is my API key secure?

- **OpenRouter key:** Stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB
- **Never sent to our servers:** API calls go directly from your browser to OpenRouter

## Troubleshooting

### The app is stuck loading

1. Check internet connection
2. Try hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check browser console for errors

### Questions don't generate

1. Check API configuration
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Check for rate limiting
4. See [Troubleshooting Guide](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### App doesn't work offline

1. Wait for service worker to install
2. Check Cache Storage in DevTools
3. Ensure you've visited pages before going offline
